WP Audio Player

WordPress Audio Player module for WebsiteBaker or Lepton CMS

The wpaudioplayer module provides the well-known flash-based audio player from
WordPress for WebseiteBaker or Lepton CMS.

WPAudioPlayer can appear in several sections on a page with just one song or
a playlist. You can override the information from the MP3 tags with you own,
you can set songs to autostart and you can configure whether a download list
is being shown or not.
In the general overview, you can quickly remove files from playlists - deletion
is for safety reasons only possible when editing the file's settings.

WPAudioPlayer comes with built-in HTML5 fallback. However, this may not always
provide you with the expected results. If no player elements are shown this
means your browser doesn't support this fallback solution. If player elements
are shown but refuse to play means that your browser doesn't support the media
type, e.g. MP3.

As a special feature you can track your player calls through Piwik. Just create
a goal in your Piwik installation and enter that goal id in WPAudioPlayer backend
- it's as easy as that.

WPAudioPlayer should do fine in both WebsiteBaker, and Lepton CMS. If you encounter
problems with WPAudioPlayer, please tell me which CMS you use and provide me
with the version number.

Thank you and have fun :-)
